# How data is anonymized

## Introduction

In many cases, it's necessary to collect data for analysis or research purposes. However, it's important to protect the privacy of the individuals whose data is being collected. Anonymizing data is one way to accomplish this. In this readme file, we will explain how we anonymize data to ensure the privacy and security of our users.

## Data Collection

When collecting data, we take several steps to ensure that the data we collect is anonymized. We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) such as IP addresses. Instead, we use tokens to identify individual users. These tokens are randomly generated and cannot be used to identify the user. We also ensure that the data we collect is encrypted during transmission and storage to prevent unauthorized access.

## Anonymization Process

Once we have collected the data, we anonymize it by removing any identifying information. This includes any PII that may have been inadvertently collected, such as email addresses. Even if an email address is available, we delete it and do not use it. This ensures that the data cannot be traced back to an individual user.

We also take additional steps to ensure that the data cannot be re-identified. For example, we may aggregate the data or add noise to it to obscure any patterns or trends that could be used to identify an individual.

## Conclusion

Anonymizing data is essential to protecting the privacy and security of our users. By following the steps outlined in this readme file, we ensure that the data we collect cannot be used to identify individual users.
