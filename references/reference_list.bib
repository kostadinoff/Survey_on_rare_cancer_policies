  abstract       = {Abstract

Background
There are no epidemiological studies describing rare cancers in Western Australia ({WA}). We aimed to fill this gap by estimating the incidence and five-year survival of rare, less common and common cancers in {WA}, based on definitions for rarity used by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and cancer groupings from the project on Surveillance of Rare Cancers in Europe ({RARECARE}). This research will enable policy- and decision-makers to better understand the size and nature of the public health problem presented by rare cancers in {WA}. It is anticipated that this study will inform improved health service design and delivery for all {WA} cancer patients, but particularly those with rare and less common cancers.


Methods
We estimated incidence and five-year survival rates of rare, less common and common cancers in {WA} using data sourced from the {WA} Cancer Registry for the 2013–2017 period. Cancers were defined as rare ({\textless} 6), less common (6–12), or common ({\textgreater} 12) based on their crude incidence rate per 100,000 people per year.


Results
Rare cancers make up 21.5\% of all cancer diagnoses in {WA}, with a significantly poorer five-year survival of 58.2\% (95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 57.3–59.1\%), compared to patients diagnosed with a common cancer, whose five-year survival was 87.8\% (95\% {CI} 87.3–88.3\%). Survival for less common cancers was significantly poorer than both rare and common cancers, at 48.1\% (95\% {CI} 47.3–49.0\%). Together, rare and less common cancers represent 48.4\% of all cancer diagnoses in {WA}.


Conclusions
While rare cancers are individually scarce, collectively over one in five cancer patients in {WA} are diagnosed with a rare cancer. These patients experience significantly worse prognoses compared to patients with common cancers.},

  abstract       = {Introduction:
Rare cancers are a challenge for clinical practice as well as for epidemiology and public health. Studies on this subject are few and limited to the study of cases with scarce epidemiologic information. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of rare cancers and to compare the demographic, anatomic, and histologic characteristics of rare and nonrare (common) cancers.


Methods:
Incidence data were obtained from the Population-based Cancer Registry of São Paulo, Brazil. Rare neoplasms were those defined in the {RARECARE} list, which takes into account an incidence lower than 6/100,000/year.


Results:
In São Paulo, 20.4\% of tumors had an incidence lower than 6/100,000/year from 1997 to 2012, being therefore considered as rare tumors. We identified 11 entities with an incidence greater than 6/100,000/year (common neoplasms) and 186 entities with an incidence lower than 6/100,000/year (rare neoplasms). The mean annual incidence of all cancers was 365 per 100,000 in São Paulo between 1997 and 2012, and the incidence of all rare tumors was 74.5 per 100,000.


Conclusions:
This study presents the burden of rare cancers in Brazil. It is expected to be an incentive for further studies of these entities in order to know the epidemiologic profile of rare tumors in Brazil and to provide a more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approach.},

Background
Patients with rare cancers face challenges in the diagnostic and treatment phase, and in access to clinical expertise. Since studies on health care experiences of these patients in comparison to patients with more common cancers are scarce, we aimed to explore these differences.


Methods
Data were cross-sectionally collected among (former) adult cancer patients through a national online survey in the Netherlands (October 2019). Descriptive statistics were reported and subgroups (rare vs. common patients) were compared.


Results

In total, 7343 patients (i.e., 1856 rare and 5487 common cancer patients) participated. Rare cancer patients were more often diagnosed and treated in different hospitals compared to common cancer patients (67\% vs. 59\%,
p
{\textless} 0.001). Rare cancer patients received treatment more often in a single hospital (60\% vs. 57\%,
p
= 0.014), but reported more negative experiences when treated in multiple hospitals than common cancer patients (14\% vs. 9\%,
p
{\textless} 0.001). They also more often received advise from their physician about the hospital to go to for a second opinion (50\% vs. 36\%,
p
{\textless} 0.001), were more likely to choose a hospital specialized in their cancer type (33\% vs. 22\%,
p
{\textless} 0.001), and were more willing to travel as long as necessary to receive specialized care than common cancer patients (55\% vs. 47\%,
p
{\textless} 0.001).



Conclusions
Rare and common cancer patients differ in their health care experiences. Health care for rare cancer patients can be further improved by proper referral to centers of expertise and building a clinical network specifically for rare cancers.},

  abstract       = {Objective.
Rare cancers have been traditionally understudied, reducing the progress of research and hindering decisions for patients, physicians, and policy makers. We evaluated the descriptive epidemiology of rare cancers using a large, representative, population-based dataset from cancer registries in the United States.


Methods.
We analyzed more than 9 million adult cancers diagnosed from 1995 to 2004 in 39 states and two metropolitan areas using the Cancer in North America ({CINA}) dataset, which covers approximately 80\% of the U.S. population. We applied an accepted cancer classification scheme and a published definition of rare (i.e., fewer than 15 cases per 100,000 per year). We calculated age-adjusted incidence rates and rare/non-rare incidence rate ratios using {SEER}*Stat software, with analyses stratified by gender, age, race/ethnicity, and histology.


Results.
Sixty of 71 cancer types were rare, accounting for 25\% of all adult tumors. Rare cancers occurred with greater relative frequency among those who were younger, nonwhite, and of Hispanic ethnicity than among their older, white, or non-Hispanic counterparts.


Conclusions.
Collectively, rare tumors account for a sizable portion of adult cancers, and disproportionately affect some demographic groups. Maturing population-based cancer surveillance data can be an important source for research on rare cancers, potentially leading to a greater understanding of these cancers and eventually to improved treatment, control, and prevention.},

Purpose:
Patients with rare cancers (incidence less than 6 cases per 100,000 persons per year) commonly have less treatment opportunities and are understudied at the level of genomic targets. We hypothesized that patients with rare cancer benefit from approved anticancer drugs outside their label similar to common cancers.


Experimental Design:
In the Drug Rediscovery Protocol ({DRUP}), patients with therapy-refractory metastatic cancers harboring an actionable molecular profile are matched to {FDA}/European Medicines Agency–approved targeted therapy or immunotherapy. Patients are enrolled in parallel cohorts based on the histologic tumor type, molecular profile and study drug. Primary endpoint is clinical benefit (complete response, partial response, stable disease ≥ 16 weeks).


Results:
Of 1,145 submitted cases, 500 patients, including 164 patients with rare cancers, started one of the 25 available drugs and were evaluable for treatment outcome. The overall clinical benefit rate was 33\% in both the rare cancer and nonrare cancer subgroup. Inactivating alterations of {CDKN}2A and activating {BRAF} aberrations were overrepresented in patients with rare cancer compared with nonrare cancers, resulting in more matches to {CDK}4/6 inhibitors (14\% vs. 4\%; P ≤ 0.001) or {BRAF} inhibitors (9\% vs. 1\%; P ≤ 0.001). Patients with rare cancer treated with small-molecule inhibitors targeting {BRAF} experienced higher rates of clinical benefit (75\%) than the nonrare cancer subgroup.


Conclusions:
Comprehensive molecular testing in patients with rare cancers may identify treatment opportunities and clinical benefit similar to patients with common cancers. Our findings highlight the importance of access to broad molecular diagnostics to ensure equal treatment opportunities for all patients with cancer.},

Съчетавайки медико-социалната парадигма на редките заболявания с клиничния профил на онкологията, редките тумори имат потенциал да бъдат самостоятелна област за действие с изключително висока степен на добавена стойност.

Този нормативен акт определя критерии за обозначаването на определени лекарствени продукти като лекарства сираци за превенция, диагностика и лечение на редки състояния, както и осигурява стимули за тяхното проучване, разработване и предлагане на пазара. Въпреки че редките болести фигурират в някои по-ранни документи на европейското законодателство, този регламент е първият, който специално и ексклузивно засяга проблемите на хората с редки болести и техните семейства в Европа.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Двадесет години по-късно е време за равносметка. В този контекст, Европейската комисия проведе серия от обществени допитвания с различни заинтересовани страни, последвани от проучване на ефекта и резултатите от Регламент (ЕО) № 141/2000. Поводите за задоволство са много, но и идентифицираните проблеми не са никак малко. По най-важния въпрос обаче – адекватен достъп на пациентите с редки болести до терапия с лекарства сираци – успехът е частичен. Да, броят на лекарствата сираци, получили разрешение за пазарна употреба в ЕС, е значителен. Но в същото време се констатират огромни неравенства при достъпа до тях по страни членки. Съществена част от тези терапии остават недостъпни за пациентите от Източна Европа.&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

  abstractnote = {&lt;p&gt;Традиционно, подходът при оценка на лекарствата сираци в Германия спада към т.нар. модел с фокус върху добавените здравни ползи. Това означава, че водещ критерий при вземане на решение за заплащане с публични средства е не разходната ефективност (както например е във Великобритания), а допълнителните здравни резултати на новата терапия спрямо алтернативата за сравнение. Привържениците на тази методология смятат за нейно основно предимство бързия достъп на пациентите до иновативни лечения, докато противниците й акцентират върху липсата на ефективен контрол върху разходите и цялостното бюджетно въздействие след това.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Оценката на лекарствата сираци в Германия се характеризира с друга особеност, характерна само за тази юрисдикция. Влезлият в сила през 2011 г. Закон за реформа на пазара на лекарствени продукти освобождава лекарствените терапии с орфанно обозначение от първоначална пълна оценка на здравните ползи. Вместо това, разрешението за пазарна употреба по централизираната процедура на Европейската лекарствена агенция служи като доказателство за наличие на добавени здравни ползи и съответно лекарствата сираци подлежат на съкратена процедура за ускорен достъп. Пълна оценка на тези здравни технологии е задължителна само когато определен лекарствен продукт надвиши 50 милиона евро обем на годишните продажби. В този случай вече, Институтът за качество и ефикасност в здравеопазването следва да извърши пълна оценка на здравните ползи, а Федералният съвместен комитет може да преразгледа решението си за достъп в светлината на представените доказателства. Десет години по-късно е време за равносметка.&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

  abstract  = {Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a rare disease with an unknown etiology. Its distribution suggests that occupational exposures may play a role. In the present study, we searched for occupational factors associated with MF. A European multicenter case-control study on seven rare cancers, including MF, was conducted from 1995 to 1997. Patients between 35 and 69 years of age diagnosed with MF (n = 134) were identified and their diagnoses were checked by a reference pathologist who classified 83 cases as definitive, 35 cases as possible, and 16 cases as not histologically verified Of the 118 histologically verified cases, 104 were interviewed, of which 76 were definitive cases. As controls, we selected population controls and colon cancer controls to serve all seven case groups. Altogether, 833 colon cancer controls and 2071 population controls were interviewed. The response rate was 91.5% for cases (76 of the 83 definitive cases), and 66.6% for controls. A high risk of MF for men was observed in the industries of other non-metallic mineral products (Odds Ratio [OR] 5.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7-16.2) and of wholesale trade (OR 3.6, 95% CI = 1.3-10.5). A high risk was found for female employees in the sector of pulp paper manufacture (OR 14.4, 95% CI = 2.2-95.1). The male occupations with the highest risks were glass formers, potters, and ceramics workers (OR 17.9, 95% CI = 5.4-59.4) and technical salesmen (OR 8.6, 95% CI = 2.4-30.8). For women, the occupations associated with the highest risks were government executives (OR 4.8, 95% CI = 1.0-22.6) and railway and road vehicles loaders (OR 3.9, 95% CI = 1.0-14.0). The results suggest that some occupational factors are associated with MF. Working as glass formers, pottery, and ceramics workers carried the highest risk, and these findings deserve further attention and replication. Females working in the paper and pulp industries may also be exposed to carcinogens of relevance to MF.},

  abstract       = {Rare pediatric tumors account for approximately 10\% of all childhood cancers, which in themselves are a rare entity. The diverse histologies and clinical behaviors of rare pediatric tumors pose challenges to the investigation of their biologic and clinical features. National and international cooperative groups such as the Rare Tumor Committee of the Children's Oncology Group, Rare Tumors in Pediatric Age Project, and European Cooperative Study Group for Pediatric Rare Tumors have developed several initiatives to advance knowledge about rare pediatric cancers. However, these programs have been only partially effective, necessitating the development of alternative mechanisms to study these challenging diseases. In this article, we review the current national and international collaborative strategies to study rare pediatric cancers and alternative methods under exploration to enhance those efforts, such as independent registries and disease-specific, National Cancer Institute–sponsored clinics.},

These diagnoses are underpinned by an internationally accepted taxonomy – the World Health Organization Classification of Tumours. This is still largely based on the histopathological examination of biopsy specimens, but increasingly also molecular methods and radiological examination of patients. Classifications evolve as new evidence arises, and for tumours that evidence is available in a quantity that is both remarkable and daunting. Evaluating this deluge of new information and incorporating it into the World Health Organization Classification of Tumours is now the responsibility of an editorial board, and up to 200 editors and authors work on each system to update it within the new 5th edition. Just as cancer researchers depend on the classification for diagnoses, so too the classification depends on the generation of high-quality, trustworthy data by cancer researchers. It is not just a case of quantity but quality too. Scientific fraud is thankfully rare, but high-profile cases are damaging and standards need to improve, not least to ensure that accurate information enters the classification.},

Starting from the economic definition of value and healthcare evaluation, efficacy and efficiency, it includes the equity dimension to define value-based healthcare. It embraces also the cultural framework associated to the concepts of health and disease, normal and pathological, right or wrong for the patient. The paper highlights that a prevention and recovery view and global evaluation of costs/benefits ratio for rare diseases make difficult and limited the applicability of the value-based approach to rare diseases. Since epidemiology of rare diseases identified a series of difficulties in applying value-based public health strategies to rare diseases, the paper underlines the necessity of new culture of health and well-being, radically re-examining how to organise the delivery of prevention, and healthcare services, and finding alternative ways of empowering and giving voice to vulnerable and marginalised groups.},

Недостатъчността на данните се дължи най-вече на липсата на епидемиологични регистри на регионално или национално ниво, както и косвено на непълнотата на Международната класификация на болестите, в която огромен брой редки състояния не са описани и нямат собствен код. Епидемологичните регистри могат да дадат основа за разрешаване на тези проблеми чрез събирането както на ретроспективни, така и на проспективни данни. Цел на настоящата публикация е изтъкването на реалните ползи от прилагането на тези регистри за редки заболявания. Проучена е достъпната научна литература и са реферирани статии, описващи множество ползи. Регистрите могат да са полезни за всички заинтересовани страни, а именно: за пациентите и пациентските организации, търсещи помощ и информация, за инвеститорите, провеждащи проучвания, за клиницистите, лекуващи пациентите, за епидемиолозите, които анализират данните, за фармацевтичните компании, проучващи нови пазари, за здравните власти, взимащи решения за планиране в системата на здравеопазване.},

These difficulties can best be addressed through multidisciplinary, national and international collaborative efforts among researchers, clinicians, governmental bodies, and patients. Numerous governmental and private organizations now exist to facilitate cooperation between researchers and institutions. Patient advocacy organizations now play an increasingly important role in partnering with traditional research groups to promote rare tumor research. Rare Tumors is now beginning an editorial series focusing on the problems of rare tumor research. We wish to invite all researchers and clinicians who are involved in rare tumor research and treatment to contribute their observations on the problems of working in this field, either as a letter to the editor, an editorial on a select issue, or as a review paper.},

Въпреки разминаването в различните определения за редки онкологични болести, епидемиологични данни сочат, че взети заедно, те съставляват над 20% от всички онкологични диагнози. Обобщението на данните за тези редки нозологии в онкологията е ключово за тяхната по-добра диагноза, лечение. Известно е и, че тяхната регистрация е субоптимална, особено в страните от Източна Европа. Водещите проблеми в онкологията са свързани с диагнозата и откриването на туморите, за разлика от другите редки неонкологични болести и това влошава много клинични параметри. Вече има данни за удължаване на преживяемостта и подобряване на много клинични резултати при лечение и проследяване в специализирани центрове, поради което експертното поведение в специализирани центрове е силно препоръчително.

  abstractnote = {The European Union defines rare diseases (RDs) as life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions whose prevalence is less than 5 per 10,000. Moreover, for many RDs, including those of genetic origin, combined efforts are required to reduce morbidity or perinatal and early mortality, and address the considerable decline in an individual’s quality of life and socioeconomic potential. Their specificities, i.e., a limited number of patients and scarcity of relevant knowledge and expertise, make RDs a unique condition which requires wide cooperation at a supranational level. Many steps were therefore taken to develop a network of European Reference Centers and to improve RDs coding and classification. In Italy, the RDs issue was addressed in 2001 with the development of a national network and a national registry coordinated by the National Center for RDs of the Italian National Institute of Health. Registries are an important resource for the development of appropriate public health policies and research on specific RDs. Research on RDs is essential for the development of novel therapeutic approaches and requires the involvement of scientific societies and patient organizations. Nevertheless, the management of patients with a chronic-RD requires a qualified care network. The network for RDs of Piedmont and the Aosta Valley (northwest Italy) represents an example of health care organization based on the availability of advanced therapies close to the patient’s home.},

  abstractnote = {OBJECTIVES This collaborative study, based on data collected by the network of Italian Cancer Registries (AIRTUM), describes the burden of rare cancers in Italy. Estimated number of new rare cancer cases yearly diagnosed (incidence), proportion of patients alive after diagnosis (survival), and estimated number of people still alive after a new cancer diagnosis (prevalence) are provided for about 200 different cancer entities. MATERIALS AND METHODS Data herein presented were provided by AIRTUM population- based cancer registries (CRs), covering nowadays 52%of the Italian population. This monograph uses the AIRTUM database (January 2015), which includes all malignant cancer cases diagnosed between 1976 and 2010. All cases are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3). Data underwent standard quality checks (described in the AIRTUM data management protocol) and were checked against rare-cancer specific quality indicators proposed and published by RARECARE and HAEMACARE (www.rarecarenet.eu; www.haemacare.eu). The definition and list of rare cancers proposed by the RARECAREnet “Information Network on Rare Cancers” project were adopted: rare cancers are entities (defined as a combination of topographical and morphological codes of the ICD-O-3) having an incidence rate of less than 6 per 100,000 per year in the European population. This monograph presents 198 rare cancers grouped in 14 major groups. Crude incidence rates were estimated as the number of all new cancers occurring in 2000-2010 divided by the overall population at risk, for males and females (also for gender-specific tumours).The proportion of rare cancers out of the total cancers (rare and common) by site was also calculated. Incidence rates by sex and age are reported. The expected number of new cases in 2015 in Italy was estimated assuming the incidence in Italy to be the same as in the AIRTUM area. One- and 5-year relative survival estimates of cases aged 0-99 years diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 in the AIRTUM database, and followed up to 31 December 2009, were calculated using complete cohort survival analysis. To estimate the observed prevalence in Italy, incidence and follow-up data from11 CRs for the period 1992-2006 were used, with a prevalence index date of 1 January 2007. Observed prevalence in the general population was disentangled by time prior to the reference date (≤2 years, 2-5 years, ≤15 years). To calculate the complete prevalence proportion at 1 January 2007 in Italy, the 15-year observed prevalence was corrected by the completeness index, in order to account for those cancer survivors diagnosed before the cancer registry activity started. The completeness index by cancer and age was obtained by means of statistical regression models, using incidence and survival data available in the European RARECAREnet data. RESULTS In total, 339,403 tumours were included in the incidence analysis. The annual incidence rate (IR) of all 198 rare cancers in the period 2000-2010 was 147 per 100,000 per year, corresponding to about 89,000 new diagnoses in Italy each year, accounting for 25% of all cancer. Five cancers, rare at European level, were not rare in Italy because their IR was higher than 6 per 100,000; these tumours were: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and squamous cell carcinoma of larynx (whose IRs in Italy were 7 per 100,000), multiple myeloma (IR: 8 per 100,000), hepatocellular carcinoma (IR: 9 per 100,000) and carcinoma of thyroid gland (IR: 14 per 100,000). Among the remaining 193 rare cancers, more than two thirds (No. 139) had an annual IR <0.5 per 100,000, accounting for about 7,100 new cancers cases; for 25 cancer types, the IR ranged between 0.5 and 1 per 100,000, accounting for about 10,000 new diagnoses; while for 29 cancer types the IR was between 1 and 6 per 100,000, accounting for about 41,000 new cancer cases. Among all rare cancers diagnosed in Italy, 7% were rare haematological diseases (IR: 41 per 100,000), 18% were solid rare cancers. Among the latter, the rare epithelial tumours of the digestive system were the most common (23%, IR: 26 per 100,000), followed by epithelial tumours of head and neck (17%, IR: 19) and rare cancers of the female genital system (17%, IR: 17), endocrine tumours (13% including thyroid carcinomas and less than 1% with an IR of 0.4 excluding thyroid carcinomas), sarcomas (8%, IR: 9 per 100,000), central nervous system tumours and rare epithelial tumours of the thoracic cavity (5%with an IR equal to 6 and 5 per 100,000, respectively). The remaining (rare male genital tumours, IR: 4 per 100,000; tumours of eye, IR: 0.7 per 100,000; neuroendocrine tumours, IR: 4 per 100,000; embryonal tumours, IR: 0.4 per 100,000; rare skin tumours and malignant melanoma of mucosae, IR: 0.8 per 100,000) each constituted <4% of all solid rare cancers. Patients with rare cancers were on average younger than those with common cancers. Essentially, all childhood cancers were rare, while after age 40 years, the common cancers (breast, prostate, colon, rectum, and lung) became increasingly more frequent. For 254,821 rare cancers diagnosed in 2000-2008, 5-year RS was on average 55%, lower than the corresponding figures for patients with common cancers (68%). RS was lower for rare cancers than for common cancers at 1 year and continued to diverge up to 3 years, while the gap remained constant from 3 to 5 years after diagnosis. For rare and common cancers, survival decreased with increasing age. Five-year RS was similar and high for both rare and common cancers up to 54 years; it decreased with age, especially after 54 years, with the elderly (75+ years) having a 37% and 20% lower survival than those aged 55-64 years for rare and common cancers, respectively. We estimated that about 900,000 people were alive in Italy with a previous diagnosis of a rare cancer in 2010 (prevalence). The highest prevalence was observed for rare haematological diseases (278 per 100,000) and rare tumours of the female genital system (265 per 100,000). Very low prevalence (<10 prt 100,000) was observed for rare epithelial skin cancers, for rare epithelial tumours of the digestive system and rare epithelial tumours of the thoracic cavity. COMMENTS One in four cancers cases diagnosed in Italy is a rare cancer, in agreement with estimates of 24% calculated in Europe overall. In Italy, the group of all rare cancers combined, include 5 cancer types with an IR>6 per 100,000 in Italy, in particular thyroid cancer (IR: 14 per 100,000).The exclusion of thyroid carcinoma from rare cancers reduces the proportion of them in Italy in 2010 to 22%. Differences in incidence across population can be due to the different distribution of risk factors (whether environmental, lifestyle, occupational, or genetic), heterogeneous diagnostic intensity activity, as well as different diagnostic capacity; moreover heterogeneity in accuracy of registration may determine some minor differences in the account of rare cancers. Rare cancers had worse prognosis than common cancers at 1, 3, and 5 years from diagnosis. Differences between rare and common cancers were small 1 year after diagnosis, but survival for rare cancers declined more markedly thereafter, consistent with the idea that treatments for rare cancers are less effective than those for common cancers. However, differences in stage at diagnosis could not be excluded, as 1- and 3-year RS for rare cancers was lower than the corresponding figures for common cancers. Moreover, rare cancers include many cancer entities with a bad prognosis (5-year RS <50%): cancer of head and neck, oesophagus, small intestine, ovary, brain, biliary tract, liver, pleura, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid and lymphatic leukaemia; in contrast, most common cancer cases are breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, which have a good prognosis. The high prevalence observed for rare haematological diseases and rare tumours of the female genital system is due to their high incidence (the majority of haematological diseases are rare and gynaecological cancers added up to fairly high incidence rates) and relatively good prognosis. The low prevalence of rare epithelial tumours of the digestive system was due to the low survival rates of the majority of tumours included in this group (oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, and liver), regardless of the high incidence rate of rare epithelial cancers of these sites. This AIRTUM study confirms that rare cancers are a major public health problem in Italy and provides quantitative estimations, for the first time in Italy, to a problem long known to exist. This monograph provides detailed epidemiologic indicators for almost 200 rare cancers, the majority of which (72%) are very rare (IR<0.5 per 100,000). These data are of major interest for different stakeholders. Health care planners can find useful information herein to properly plan and think of how to reorganise health care services. Researchers now have numbers to design clinical trials considering alternative study designs and statistical approaches. Population-based cancer registries with good quality data are the best source of information to describe the rare cancer burden in a population.},

Whether the type of portfolio creation and portfolio management strategies that have worked for common cancers also work best for rare cancers warrants asking. This commentary argues for consideration of additional approaches. Incorporating principles and successes from large-scale network-based clinical trials and from advocacy-based research, and new ways to approach consortia, might accelerate the quantity and improve the quality of future rare-cancer research. Rare cancers significantly influence the overall cancer burden and cancer disparities. Creative community-based approaches to improve rare-cancers research should be considered.

  abstractnote = {Abstract Background Even though the classification of cancer tissue samples based on gene expression data has advanced considerably in recent years, it faces great challenges to improve accuracy. One of the challenges is to establish an effective method that can select a parsimonious set of relevant genes. So far, most methods for gene selection in literature focus on screening individual or pairs of genes without considering the possible interactions among genes. Here we introduce a new computational method named the Binary Matrix Shuffling Filter (BMSF). It not only overcomes the difficulty associated with the search schemes of traditional wrapper methods and overfitting problem in large dimensional search space but also takes potential gene interactions into account during gene selection. This method, coupled with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for implementation, often selects very small number of genes for easy model interpretability. Results We applied our method to 9 two-class gene expression datasets involving human cancers. During the gene selection process, the set of genes to be kept in the model was recursively refined and repeatedly updated according to the effect of a given gene on the contributions of other genes in reference to their usefulness in cancer classification. The small number of informative genes selected from each dataset leads to significantly improved leave-one-out (LOOCV) classification accuracy across all 9 datasets for multiple classifiers. Our method also exhibits broad generalization in the genes selected since multiple commonly used classifiers achieved either equivalent or much higher LOOCV accuracy than those reported in literature. Conclusions Evaluation of a gene’s contribution to binary cancer classification is better to be considered after adjusting for the joint effect of a large number of other genes. A computationally efficient search scheme was provided to perform effective search in the extensive feature space that includes possible interactions of many genes. Performance of the algorithm applied to 9 datasets suggests that it is possible to improve the accuracy of cancer classification by a big margin when joint effects of many genes are considered.},

Traditional classification use morphology to divide tumors into separate categories with differing behavior and prognosis. However, there are limitations of traditional classification systems, and new molecular methods are expected to improve classification systems. Molecular subtypes of breast carcinomas have been characterized in the last 11 years, and have been studied extensively. Much of the information accumulated in recent years, and molecular taxonomy seems to be still developing and undergoing change. The main question is whether new molecular techniques such as gene expression profiling will be accepted as gold standard in determining breast cancer subtypes, and whether molecular classification is useful in specific subtypes of breast cancer as it is in ductal carcinoma (nonspecific type). In addition, critical review of the literature reveals major problems such as poor definition, lack of reproducibility and lack of quality control in current molecular techniques and classifications. Therefore, current molecular approaches are not yet used in routine clinical practice and treatment guidance since they are immature and can even lead to incorrect assessment.},

A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},

Personalized medicine is rooted in the belief that since individuals possess nuanced and unique characteristics at the molecular, physiological, environmental exposure, and behavioral levels, they may need to have interventions provided to them for diseases they possess that are tailored to these nuanced and unique characteristics. This belief has been verified to some degree through the application of emerging technologies such as DNA sequencing, proteomics, imaging protocols, and wireless health monitoring devices, which have revealed great inter-individual variation in disease processes. In this review, we consider the motivation for personalized medicine, its historical precedents, the emerging technologies that are enabling it, some recent experiences including successes and setbacks, ways of vetting and deploying personalized medicines, and future directions, including potential ways of treating individuals with fertility and sterility issues. We also consider current limitations of personalized medicine. We ultimately argue that since aspects of personalized medicine are rooted in biological realities, personalized medicine practices in certain contexts are likely to be inevitable, especially as relevant assays and deployment strategies become more efficient and cost-effective.},

Consequently, those affected have comparatively few treatment options, and their prognosis is worse than that of patients with more common entities. Here we review two relevant groups of rare cancers, bone and soft-tissue sarcomas and neuroendocrine tumours (NET), to illustrate recent efforts towards individualised, biology-guided clinical management to improve long-term outcomes. Specifically, we address how comprehensive, multi-layered molecular analyses, including the assessment of predisposing hereditary factors, and innovative imaging approaches can improve the diagnosis of these diseases, allow for better prognostic assessment, and provide new targets for pharmacologic and, in the case of NET, nuclear medicine interventions, whose clinical value must be determined in controlled trials optimally tailored to the particular patient population most likely to benefit. Furthermore, we describe the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in dedicated reference centres for rare cancers and the increasingly acknowledged potential of networking across institutions at a national and international level. Finally, we illustrate the value of a learning health system based on the systematic collection and sharing of the biological and clinical profiles of patients with rare cancers to achieve continuous cross-fertilisation of scientific and clinical efforts, making the vision of stratified precision medicine in these long-overlooked diseases a reality.},

Five studies focus on breast pathology, including sarcoma, lymphoma, phyllodes tumor, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and ductal carcinoma in situ in young women. Three studies on prostate cancer address prostatic small cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of young and elderly patients. Six studies on head and neck cancers include orbital and intraocular lymphoma, mucosal melanoma, pediatric nasopharyngeal carcinoma, olfactory neuroblastoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the salivary glands. There were 4 central nervous system studies on patients with cerebellar glioblastoma multiforme, atypical and malignant meningioma, spinal epidural lymphoma and myxopapillary ependymoma. Outside of these disease sites, there is a wide variety of other studies on tumors ranging from uterine leiomyosarcoma to giant cell tumors of the bone. The studies done by the RCN represent a wide range of rare pathologies that were previously only studied in small series or case reports. With further growth of the RCN and collaboration between members our ability to analyze rare tumors will increase and result in better understanding of their behavior and ultimately help direct research that may improve patient outcomes.},

  abstractnote = {Age, sex, and racial/ethnic disparities exist, but are understudied in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to determine whether survival and treatment disparities persist after adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Our study included PDAC patients diagnosed between 1992 and 2011. We used Cox regression to compare survival across age, sex, and race/ethnicity within early-stage and late-stage cancer subgroups, adjusting for marital status, urban location, socioeconomics, SEER region, comorbidities, stage, lymph node status, tumor location, tumor grade, diagnosis year, and treatment received. We used logistic regression to compare differences in treatment received across age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Among 20,896 patients, 84% were White, 9% Black, 5% Asian, and 2% Hispanic. Median age was 75; 56% were female and 53% had late-stage cancer. Among early-stage patients in the adjusted Cox model, older patient subgroups had worse survival compared with ages 66-69 (HR > 1.1, P < 0.01 for groups >69); no survival differences existed between sexes. Black (HR = 1.1, P = 0.01) and Hispanic (HR = 1.2, P < 0.01) patients had worse survival compared with White. Among late-stage cancer patients, patients over age 84 had worse survival than those aged 66-69 (HR = 1.1, P < 0.01), and males (HR = 1.08, P < 0.01) had worse survival than females; there were no racial/ethnic differences. Older age and minority race/ethnicity were associated with lower likelihood of receiving chemotherapy, radiation, and/or surgery. Age and racial/ethnic disparities in survival outcomes and treatment received exist for PDAC patients; these disparities persist after adjusting for differences in demographic and clinical characteristics.},

The objective of this review was to analyse the content included in European NCCPs and NRDPs on RCs in adults. The working hypothesis is that RCs have a lower presence in NCCPs compared to more common cancers, and that NRDPs do not generally approach them. Methods A review based on a documentary analysis on the priorities and recommendations in the area of RCs was conducted in 15 European NCCPs and 18 NRDPs. After identifying the areas covered therein, we performed a thematic analysis to allow a narrative description of the status of RCs? health policy. Results Rare cancers are hardly addressed in NCCPs and not addressed in NRDPs. Of the 15 NCCPs analysed, only 8 contained some elements on RCs, and only 3 of these described specific measures to address this disease group or took a comprehensive approach. The cross-cutting analysis of the 8 NCCPs allowed identifying 14 critical issues necessary to reach a comprehensive approach to RCs? policy. Conclusions The scarce presence of RCs in most of NCCPs may indicate low visibility and limited political understanding of their specificities. The critical issues emerging from the analysis are intended to improving the national policy frameworks addressing RC challenges and to place the NCCPs as strategic documents that must play a key role in this process.},

Physical and psycho-social needs have been identified in survivors of common cancers but
very little has been written about the needs of patients with rarer cancers. Patients
treated for rarer cancer are discharged to the primary health care team (PHCT), yet little
is known about the assessment, management and support of these patients. Thirty-nine
semi-structured interviews were conducted with (1) survivors of and (2) people living with
rarer cancer (i.e. o5% of cancer burden). Participants were asked about physical and
psycho-social needs and service provision. Data were analysed thematically using Atlas ti.
Contrary to expectation, disease-free survivors of rarer cancer were indistinguishable from
those living with disease in their ability to cope, and range of symptoms and needs.
Participants with a clinical nurse specialist (CNS) reported that they were well supported
on their return home and their needs were met. Participants without a CNS were referred
to the PHCT who were unsure how to assess or support them. These participants felt
abandoned. There is a need for the rehabilitation of patients with rarer cancer to
strengthen individual coping mechanisms, and family and social support. Although there
are resource and training implications, this is a potential role for the PHCT, district nursing
in particular, and may lead to more focused and targeted provision of services.},

Of these four neoplasms, two are common (lung and breast) and two rare (pleura and STS); two have well recognized risk factors (lung and pleura) while the other two (breast and STS) have no single strong risk factor. Data were analysed at a small-area level (1206 municipalities, population 39 to 989 663), using both standardized mortality ratios and Bayesian-estimated mortality risks. The Bayesian model allowed for both heterogeneity (through spatially independent random effects) and clustering (through spatially correlated random effects) and, by borrowing information from neighbouring areas, provided stable estimates for areas with sparse data. The aim was to reduce the noise in the disease maps to highlight the true underlying mortality distribution. Lung cancer in men showed strong spatial structure with a marked east-west gradient, but no appreciable urban-rural differences. In contrast, high mortality areas for female lung cancer were observed around conurbations. Female breast cancer and STS appeared to be spread uniformly across the region. Pleural cancer mortality clusters were evident around areas with major asbestos manufacturers, or natural asbestiform fibre pollution. Maps of Bayesian-estimated mortality risk provided appreciably clearer pictures of risk distribution than did maps of the standardized mortality ratio.},

  abstract  = {Rare Diseases Epidemiology' offers numerous approaches to increase the knowledge base of rare diseases and conditions and to facilitate the development and dissemination of interventions for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of over 6500 diseases and conditions. The goals of epidemiology are not restricted merely to providing numerical data on the prevalence or incidence of diseases in a limited or general population. Analyses of epidemiological data gathered from appropriately designed and conducted studies are required to establish public health policies and priorities in all nations. Information gained from these studies lead to a better understanding of the etiology and the impact of genetic or environmental factors on the occurrence and outcome of these disorders. The term Rare Diseases includes both acquired and inherited disorders. 'Rare Diseases Epidemiology' provides methods and approaches from the collective experiences of established research investigators who address these significant issues of the development of patient registries; the collection, storage and selected distribution of bio-specimens from bio-banking activities; the validation and utilization of genetic testing and newborn screening procedures; the presentation of issues related to the importance of case reports to increase knowledge of rare diseases; the challenges and models for population-based surveillance studies for rare congenital and inherited disorders; the statistical methods for the geographical analyses of rare diseases; the value and need for clinical trials and comparative effective studies; and meeting the requirements of regulatory agencies. Economic, societal, and ethical concerns are presented as patients and families encounter difficulties obtaining the correct diagnosis, gaining access to treatments, and receiving coverage or reimbursement for approved interventions, and for developing a public understanding of the costs to patients and their families and the burden of illness affecting the quality of life of millions of patients with rare diseases and conditions. Framework programs for rare diseases research as developed by the European Union and the value of national plans for individual member countries are discussed and represent the public commitment to patients with rare diseases. Likewise, similar programs have been implemented in the USA as a result of the Orphan Drug Act to address the needs of the rare diseases community.},

Uncertainty analysis is a stable component of risk assessment and is increasingly used in decision making on complex health issues. Uncertainties should be identified in a structured way and prioritized according to their likely impact on the outcome of scientific conclusions. Uncertainty is inherent to the rare diseases (RD) area, where research and healthcare have to cope with knowledge gaps due to the rarity of the conditions; yet a systematic approach toward uncertainties is not usually undertaken. The uncertainty issue is particularly relevant to multifactorial RD, whose etiopathogenesis involves environmental factors and genetic predisposition. Three case studies are presented: the newly recognized acute multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; the assessment of risk factors for neural tube defects; and the genotype-phenotype correlation in familial Mediterranean fever. Each case study proposes the initial identification of the main epistemic and sampling uncertainties and their impacts. Uncertainty analysis in RD may present aspects similar to those encountered when conducting risk assessment in data-poor scenarios; therefore, approaches such as expert knowledge elicitation may be considered. The RD community has a main strength in managing uncertainty, as it proactively develops stakeholder involvement, data sharing and open science. The open science approaches can be profitably integrated by structured uncertainty analysis, especially when dealing with multifactorial RD involving environmental and genetic risk factors.},

Up-to-date evidence on the total cost of cancer is needed to inform policy decisions. This study estimates the cost of cancer in Europe in 2018 and extends a previous analysis for 1995-2014. METHODS: Cancer-specific health expenditure were derived from national estimates. Data on cancer drug sales were obtained from IQVIA. The productivity loss from premature mortality was estimated from data from Eurostat and the World Health Organization. Estimates of the productivity loss from morbidity and informal care costs were based on previous studies. FINDINGS: The total cost of cancer was €199 billion in Europe (EU-27 plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom) in 2018. Total costs ranged from €160 per capita in Romania to €578 in Switzerland (after adjustment for price differentials). Health expenditure on cancer care were €103 billion, of which €32 billion were spent on cancer drugs. Informal care costs were €26 billion. The total productivity loss was €70 billion, composed of €50 billion from premature mortality and €20 billion from morbidity. INTERPRETATION: Health expenditure on cancer care were of a similar magnitude as the sum of non-health-care costs in 2018. Over the last two decades, health spending on cancer has increased faster than the increase in cancer incidence. The productivity loss from premature mortality has decreased because of reductions in mortality in the working-age population. Trends in informal care costs and productivity loss from morbidity are uncertain because of lack of comparable data.},

However, little is known about their perceived quality of care (QoC) and quality of life (QoL) in the advanced disease stage. We aimed to assess the QoC and QoL as experienced by patients with advanced rare cancers compared to patients with advanced common cancers. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, baseline data of patients with advanced cancer from the multicentre, longitudinal, observational eQuipe study were analysed. Multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to assess differences in experienced QoC (continuity of care, continuity of information, and satisfaction with care) and QoL (functioning, symptoms, overall QoL, and social wellbeing) between advanced rare and common cancer patients. RESULTS: Of the 1087 included patients, 106 (9.8%) had a rare cancer type. In comparison to patients with advanced common cancers, patients with advanced rare cancers experienced significantly lower continuity of care (77.8 vs. 71.1 respectively, p = 0.011) and social functioning (78.8 vs. 72.6 respectively, p = 0.012). No differences were found regarding continuity of information, satisfaction with care, overall QoL, and social wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced rare cancers experience less continuity of care, and the impact of the disease on social and family life seems higher compared to patients with advanced common cancers. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: To enhance the QoC and QoL of patients with advanced rare cancers, supportive care should mainly focus on improving continuity of care and patients’ social functioning.},

  abstractnote = {In high-income countries the public policy consensus is that costs of delivering high-quality equitable cancer care present an increasing challenge to national budgets. In the U.S. alone it is estimated cancer care expenditures in 2020 will be 157 billion dollars. The increase is being driven by a number of factors including technological innovation, rising costs of medical and hospital care, expensive therapeutics and an increase in the proportion of individuals susceptible to malignancy as the population ages. In this article we review what factors are informing and influencing the political debate on cancer economics across Europe and North America. We have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the literature and supplemented this with key informant interviews within each region. An important theme is the increasing role of individual patients, organisations and physicians in advocating for greater access to and fairer prices for cancer therapies. Whilst health technology assessments (HTAs) are increasingly prevalent their role in informing reimbursement policy is influenced by public and political scrutiny, which impacts their ability to ensure access to high value cost effective care. Austerity measures following the global recession have created inequities in access to drugs with concern about the impact on subsequent outcomes. The cancer economics debate has largely centred on the provision of drugs, with access to radiotherapy and over-penetration of high cost radiation technologies under-represented in media outputs and political discussion. Future work should enhance collaborative efforts to assess relative effectiveness and to provide real-world data. These debates are becoming increasingly complex, even as we face stagnating health budgets. We must also be aware of the key factors that play a significant role in cancer policy aside from economics including socio-cultural values, advocacy and political influence at the country and regional level.},

In Belgium, every hospital with a programme in oncology can deliver care for adults with rare and/or complex cancer types, without having demonstrated a specific know-how to adequately manage these patients. Therefore, the Minister of Health ordered a scenario for the organisation of care for adults with rare and/or complex cancers, taking into account the current Belgian situation and relevant foreign experience. Methods Combined methods were used in this study: a literature review, the consultation of stakeholders, in depth discussions in 14 multidisciplinary groups leading to concrete proposals for several rare/complex cancers and the consultation of a panel of expert pathologists. Results The core recommendation is the set-up of shared care networks around reference centres, with multidisciplinary teams of recognised expertise in specific rare/complex cancers. The definition of minimum caseloads for hospitals and medical specialists, the evaluation of the quality of care, a model of diagnostic confirmation and the set-up of a national portal website which provides information on rare and/or complex cancers and reference centres are highly recommended. Conclusion It is no longer practicable, efficient or ethical that every hospital or every practitioner continues to offer care for every rare/complex cancer. Improving the quality of rare/complex cancer care requires to concentrate expertise and sophisticated infrastructure in reference centres. Furthermore, the formation of networks between reference centres and peripheral centres will allow a delivery of care combining expertise and proximity. The next step is the translation of the recommendations into policy decisions. It is very well realised that this will take some courage and that a certain degree of resistance will have to be surmounted, but eventually, the best interest of the patient should prevail},

  abstractnote = {In high-income countries the public policy consensus is that costs of delivering high-quality equitable cancer care present an increasing challenge to national budgets. In the U.S. alone it is estimated cancer care expenditures in 2020 will be 157 billion dollars. The increase is being driven by a number of factors including technological innovation, rising costs of medical and hospital care, expensive therapeutics and an increase in the proportion of individuals susceptible to malignancy as the population ages. In this article we review what factors are informing and influencing the political debate on cancer economics across Europe and North America. We have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the literature and supplemented this with key informant interviews within each region. An important theme is the increasing role of individual patients, organisations and physicians in advocating for greater access to and fairer prices for cancer therapies. Whilst health technology assessments (HTAs) are increasingly prevalent their role in informing reimbursement policy is influenced by public and political scrutiny, which impacts their ability to ensure access to high value cost effective care. Austerity measures following the global recession have created inequities in access to drugs with concern about the impact on subsequent outcomes. The cancer economics debate has largely centred on the provision of drugs, with access to radiotherapy and over-penetration of high cost radiation technologies under-represented in media outputs and political discussion. Future work should enhance collaborative efforts to assess relative effectiveness and to provide real-world data. These debates are becoming increasingly complex, even as we face stagnating health budgets. We must also be aware of the key factors that play a significant role in cancer policy aside from economics including socio-cultural values, advocacy and political influence at the country and regional level.},
