Its distribution suggests that occupational exposures may play a role. In the present study, we searched for occupational factors associated with MF. A European multicenter case-control study on seven rare cancers, including MF, was conducted from 1995 to 1997. Patients between 35 and 69 years of age diagnosed with MF (n = 134) were identified and their diagnoses were checked by a reference pathologist who classified 83 cases as definitive, 35 cases as possible, and 16 cases as not histologically verified Of the 118 histologically verified cases, 104 were interviewed, of which 76 were definitive cases. As controls, we selected population controls and colon cancer controls to serve all seven case groups. Altogether, 833 colon cancer controls and 2071 population controls were interviewed. The response rate was 91.5% for cases (76 of the 83 definitive cases), and 66.6% for controls. A high risk of MF for men was observed in the industries of other non-metallic mineral products (Odds Ratio [OR] 5.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.7-16.2) and of wholesale trade (OR 3.6, 95% CI = 1.3-10.5). A high risk was found for female employees in the sector of pulp paper manufacture (OR 14.4, 95% CI = 2.2-95.1). The male occupations with the highest risks were glass formers, potters, and ceramics workers (OR 17.9, 95% CI = 5.4-59.4) and technical salesmen (OR 8.6, 95% CI = 2.4-30.8). For women, the occupations associated with the highest risks were government executives (OR 4.8, 95% CI = 1.0-22.6) and railway and road vehicles loaders (OR 3.9, 95% CI = 1.0-14.0). The results suggest that some occupational factors are associated with MF. Working as glass formers, pottery, and ceramics workers carried the highest risk, and these findings deserve further attention and replication. Females working in the paper and pulp industries may also be exposed to carcinogens of relevance to MF.","","","",""

Of these four neoplasms, two are common (lung and breast) and two rare (pleura and STS); two have well recognized risk factors (lung and pleura) while the other two (breast and STS) have no single strong risk factor. Data were analysed at a small-area level (1206 municipalities, population 39 to 989 663), using both standardized mortality ratios and Bayesian-estimated mortality risks. The Bayesian model allowed for both heterogeneity (through spatially independent random effects) and clustering (through spatially correlated random effects) and, by borrowing information from neighbouring areas, provided stable estimates for areas with sparse data. The aim was to reduce the noise in the disease maps to highlight the true underlying mortality distribution. Lung cancer in men showed strong spatial structure with a marked east-west gradient, but no appreciable urban-rural differences. In contrast, high mortality areas for female lung cancer were observed around conurbations. Female breast cancer and STS appeared to be spread uniformly across the region. Pleural cancer mortality clusters were evident around areas with major asbestos manufacturers, or natural asbestiform fibre pollution. Maps of Bayesian-estimated mortality risk provided appreciably clearer pictures of risk distribution than did maps of the standardized mortality ratio.","","","",""

Patients treated for rarer cancer are discharged to the primary health care team (PHCT), yet little is known about the assessment, management and support of these patients. Thirty-nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with (1) survivors of and (2) people living with rarer cancer (i.e. o5% of cancer burden). Participants were asked about physical and psycho-social needs and service provision. Data were analysed thematically using Atlas ti. Contrary to expectation, disease-free survivors of rarer cancer were indistinguishable from those living with disease in their ability to cope, and range of symptoms and needs. Participants with a clinical nurse specialist (CNS) reported that they were well supported on their return home and their needs were met. Participants without a CNS were referred to the PHCT who were unsure how to assess or support them. These participants felt abandoned. There is a need for the rehabilitation of patients with rarer cancer to strengthen individual coping mechanisms, and family and social support. Although there are resource and training implications, this is a potential role for the PHCT, district nursing in particular, and may lead to more focused and targeted provision of services.","","","",""

We evaluated the descriptive epidemiology of rare cancers using a large, representative, population-based dataset from cancer registries in the United States.   Methods. We analyzed more than 9 million adult cancers diagnosed from 1995 to 2004 in 39 states and two metropolitan areas using the Cancer in North America ({CINA}) dataset, which covers approximately 80\% of the U.S. population. We applied an accepted cancer classification scheme and a published definition of rare (i.e., fewer than 15 cases per 100,000 per year). We calculated age-adjusted incidence rates and rare/non-rare incidence rate ratios using {SEER}*Stat software, with analyses stratified by gender, age, race/ethnicity, and histology.   Results. Sixty of 71 cancer types were rare, accounting for 25\% of all adult tumors. Rare cancers occurred with greater relative frequency among those who were younger, nonwhite, and of Hispanic ethnicity than among their older, white, or non-Hispanic counterparts.   Conclusions. Collectively, rare tumors account for a sizable portion of adult cancers, and disproportionately affect some demographic groups. Maturing population-based cancer surveillance data can be an important source for research on rare cancers, potentially leading to a greater understanding of these cancers and eventually to improved treatment, control, and prevention.","","","greenlee_occurrence_2010 - The Occurrence of Rare Cancers in U.S. Adults, 1995–2004.pdf",""

The goals of epidemiology are not restricted merely to providing numerical data on the prevalence or incidence of diseases in a limited or general population. Analyses of epidemiological data gathered from appropriately designed and conducted studies are required to establish public health policies and priorities in all nations. Information gained from these studies lead to a better understanding of the etiology and the impact of genetic or environmental factors on the occurrence and outcome of these disorders. The term Rare Diseases includes both acquired and inherited disorders. 'Rare Diseases Epidemiology' provides methods and approaches from the collective experiences of established research investigators who address these significant issues of the development of patient registries; the collection, storage and selected distribution of bio-specimens from bio-banking activities; the validation and utilization of genetic testing and newborn screening procedures; the presentation of issues related to the importance of case reports to increase knowledge of rare diseases; the challenges and models for population-based surveillance studies for rare congenital and inherited disorders; the statistical methods for the geographical analyses of rare diseases; the value and need for clinical trials and comparative effective studies; and meeting the requirements of regulatory agencies. Economic, societal, and ethical concerns are presented as patients and families encounter difficulties obtaining the correct diagnosis, gaining access to treatments, and receiving coverage or reimbursement for approved interventions, and for developing a public understanding of the costs to patients and their families and the burden of illness affecting the quality of life of millions of patients with rare diseases and conditions. Framework programs for rare diseases research as developed by the European Union and the value of national plans for individual member countries are discussed and represent the public commitment to patients with rare diseases. Likewise, similar programs have been implemented in the USA as a result of the Orphan Drug Act to address the needs of the rare diseases community.","","","",""

The diverse histologies and clinical behaviors of rare pediatric tumors pose challenges to the investigation of their biologic and clinical features. National and international cooperative groups such as the Rare Tumor Committee of the Children's Oncology Group, Rare Tumors in Pediatric Age Project, and European Cooperative Study Group for Pediatric Rare Tumors have developed several initiatives to advance knowledge about rare pediatric cancers. However, these programs have been only partially effective, necessitating the development of alternative mechanisms to study these challenging diseases. In this article, we review the current national and international collaborative strategies to study rare pediatric cancers and alternative methods under exploration to enhance those efforts, such as independent registries and disease-specific, National Cancer Institute–sponsored clinics.","","","",""

Следвайки обаче модела на редките болести, в научните среди все повече се говори за редките тумори. Съчетавайки медико-социалната парадигма на редките заболявания с клиничния профил на онкологията, редките тумори имат потенциал да бъдат самостоятелна област за действие с изключително висока степен на добавена стойност.  Настоящата публикация има за цел да обобщи основните епидемиологични концепции по отношение на редките злокачествени заболявания и да обсъди мястото им в здравната политика.","","","./MEGAsync/phd/pdf/iskrov_rare_tumors.pdf",""

Studies on this subject are few and limited to the study of cases with scarce epidemiologic information. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of rare cancers and to compare the demographic, anatomic, and histologic characteristics of rare and nonrare (common) cancers.   Methods: Incidence data were obtained from the Population-based Cancer Registry of São Paulo, Brazil. Rare neoplasms were those defined in the {RARECARE} list, which takes into account an incidence lower than 6/100,000/year.   Results: In São Paulo, 20.4\% of tumors had an incidence lower than 6/100,000/year from 1997 to 2012, being therefore considered as rare tumors. We identified 11 entities with an incidence greater than 6/100,000/year (common neoplasms) and 186 entities with an incidence lower than 6/100,000/year (rare neoplasms). The mean annual incidence of all cancers was 365 per 100,000 in São Paulo between 1997 and 2012, and the incidence of all rare tumors was 74.5 per 100,000.   Conclusions: This study presents the burden of rare cancers in Brazil. It is expected to be an incentive for further studies of these entities in order to know the epidemiologic profile of rare tumors in Brazil and to provide a more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approach.","","","",""

We aimed to fill this gap by estimating the incidence and five-year survival of rare, less common and common cancers in {WA}, based on definitions for rarity used by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and cancer groupings from the project on Surveillance of Rare Cancers in Europe ({RARECARE}). This research will enable policy- and decision-makers to better understand the size and nature of the public health problem presented by rare cancers in {WA}. It is anticipated that this study will inform improved health service design and delivery for all {WA} cancer patients, but particularly those with rare and less common cancers.   Methods We estimated incidence and five-year survival rates of rare, less common and common cancers in {WA} using data sourced from the {WA} Cancer Registry for the 2013–2017 period. Cancers were defined as rare ({\textless} 6), less common (6–12), or common ({\textgreater} 12) based on their crude incidence rate per 100,000 people per year.   Results Rare cancers make up 21.5\% of all cancer diagnoses in {WA}, with a significantly poorer five-year survival of 58.2\% (95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 57.3–59.1\%), compared to patients diagnosed with a common cancer, whose five-year survival was 87.8\% (95\% {CI} 87.3–88.3\%). Survival for less common cancers was significantly poorer than both rare and common cancers, at 48.1\% (95\% {CI} 47.3–49.0\%). Together, rare and less common cancers represent 48.4\% of all cancer diagnoses in {WA}.   Conclusions While rare cancers are individually scarce, collectively over one in five cancer patients in {WA} are diagnosed with a rare cancer. These patients experience significantly worse prognoses compared to patients with common cancers.","","","",""

Since studies on health care experiences of these patients in comparison to patients with more common cancers are scarce, we aimed to explore these differences.   Methods Data were cross-sectionally collected among (former) adult cancer patients through a national online survey in the Netherlands (October 2019). Descriptive statistics were reported and subgroups (rare vs. common patients) were compared.   Results  In total, 7343 patients (i.e., 1856 rare and 5487 common cancer patients) participated. Rare cancer patients were more often diagnosed and treated in different hospitals compared to common cancer patients (67\% vs. 59\%, p {\textless} 0.001). Rare cancer patients received treatment more often in a single hospital (60\% vs. 57\%, p = 0.014), but reported more negative experiences when treated in multiple hospitals than common cancer patients (14\% vs. 9\%, p {\textless} 0.001). They also more often received advise from their physician about the hospital to go to for a second opinion (50\% vs. 36\%, p {\textless} 0.001), were more likely to choose a hospital specialized in their cancer type (33\% vs. 22\%, p {\textless} 0.001), and were more willing to travel as long as necessary to receive specialized care than common cancer patients (55\% vs. 47\%, p {\textless} 0.001).    Conclusions Rare and common cancer patients differ in their health care experiences. Health care for rare cancer patients can be further improved by proper referral to centers of expertise and building a clinical network specifically for rare cancers.","","","de_heus_differences_2021 - Differences in Health Care Experiences between Rare Cancer and Common Cancer Patients_ Results from a National Cross Sectional Survey.pdf",""

We hypothesized that patients with rare cancer benefit from approved anticancer drugs outside their label similar to common cancers.   Experimental Design: In the Drug Rediscovery Protocol ({DRUP}), patients with therapy-refractory metastatic cancers harboring an actionable molecular profile are matched to {FDA}/European Medicines Agency–approved targeted therapy or immunotherapy. Patients are enrolled in parallel cohorts based on the histologic tumor type, molecular profile and study drug. Primary endpoint is clinical benefit (complete response, partial response, stable disease ≥ 16 weeks).   Results: Of 1,145 submitted cases, 500 patients, including 164 patients with rare cancers, started one of the 25 available drugs and were evaluable for treatment outcome. The overall clinical benefit rate was 33\% in both the rare cancer and nonrare cancer subgroup. Inactivating alterations of {CDKN}2A and activating {BRAF} aberrations were overrepresented in patients with rare cancer compared with nonrare cancers, resulting in more matches to {CDK}4/6 inhibitors (14\% vs. 4\%; P ≤ 0.001) or {BRAF} inhibitors (9\% vs. 1\%; P ≤ 0.001). Patients with rare cancer treated with small-molecule inhibitors targeting {BRAF} experienced higher rates of clinical benefit (75\%) than the nonrare cancer subgroup.   Conclusions: Comprehensive molecular testing in patients with rare cancers may identify treatment opportunities and clinical benefit similar to patients with common cancers. Our findings highlight the importance of access to broad molecular diagnostics to ensure equal treatment opportunities for all patients with cancer.","","","",""
